# swift-accession-numbers

Swift package for extracting accession numbers from text using the sfomuseum/accession-numbers data.

## Important

This is work in progress. It may still change and lacks documentation.

## Getting started

To get started have a look at [Tests/AccessionNumbersTests/AccessionNumbersTests.swift](https://github.com/sfomuseum/swift-accession-numbers/blob/main/Tests/AccessionNumbersTests/AccessionNumbersTests.swift)

As of this writing this package recognizes accession numbers but is still not able to extract them from arbitrary text, like a wall label. I am still feeling my way around regular expressions in Swift so any help or suggestions would be welcome.
